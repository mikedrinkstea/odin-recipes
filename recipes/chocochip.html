      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is my own chocolate chip cookie recipe that I've iterated on over the years. 
            It takes inspiration from AllRecipes, my friends, and my cooking idol, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt. 
            Crispy at the edges, soft in the middle, this cookie represents my platonic ideal of delicious.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>3 Cups All-Purpose Flour (Dry)</li>
            <li>1 Tsp Baking Powder (Dry)</li>
            <li>1 Tsp Salt (Dry)</li>
            <li>1 Cup Brown Sugar (Wet)</li>
            <li>1 Cup White Sugar (Wet)</li>
            <li>1 Cup Softened Butter (Wet)</li>
            <li>2 Eggs (Wet)</li>
            <li>2 Tsp Vanilla Extract (Wet)</li>
            <li>1 Tsp Baking Soda dissolved in Warm Water (Wet)</li>
            <li>Chocolate Chips to Taste (I use one small bag or two cups) </li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees fahreinheit.</li>
            <li>Mix together your dry ingredients in a small bowl, leave to the side</li>
            <li>For the wet ingreidents, use a larger bowl. Add both sugars together.</li>
            <li>Add the softened butter to the sugar, and mix until butter is combined and creamy.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs to the wet mixture one at a time, mixing well. Add the rest of the wet ingredients and combine.</li>
            <li>Add half of the dry mixture, combine. Add desired amount of chocolate chips. Combine.</li>
            <li>Add second half of the dry mixture. Mix until combined.</li>
            <li>(Optional but HIGHLY recommended) Leave mixture covered in fridge overnight. You could also make doughballs and refridgerate those for a shorter amount of time if wanting cookies sooner.</li>
            <li>Bake cookies on a heavy baking sheet lined with parchment paper for 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and let rest on sheet for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
