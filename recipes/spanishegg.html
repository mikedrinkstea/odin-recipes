      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I don't even remember where I picked this up, but it's delicious. The crispy edges, which a lot of people say are terrible on eggs, actually hold craggles of flavor that I find irresistable.
            On top of rice, with tortillas, or on bread, you can't go wrong with this crispy breakfast (or any time really!) treat.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An egg</li>
            <li>Cooking oil of your choosing</li>
            <li>Seasoning</li>
            <li>Carbohydrate of choice</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a heavy pan (preferably cast iron) over high heat.</li>
            <li>Once heated, add enough oil to create a quarter to half-inch layer in the pan.</li>
            <li>Once oil is shimmering (or smoking), crack the egg directly into the pan. Add salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Spoon oil over the top of the egg to cook the whites. You can choose to spoon oil on the yolk or not, depending on your preference.</li>
            <li>Remove from pan once top of egg is cooked. The bottom should separate smoothly, and be a crispy golden brown.</li>
            <li>Eat with your carb of choice, garnish with sauce if desired. I recommend rice, but toast, or tortillas and beans are good too!</li>
        </ol>
